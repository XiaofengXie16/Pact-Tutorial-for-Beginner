### Creating

1. To create a webhook, in the HAL Browser, navigate to the pact you want to create the webhook for
(Click "Go to Entry Point", then select "latest-pacts", then select the pact you want to create the webhook for.)
2. Click the "NON-GET" button for the "pact-webhooks" relation.
3. Paste in the webhook JSON (example shown below) in the body section and click "Make Request".

An example webhook to trigger a Bamboo job when a contract has changed.

    {
      "events": [{
        "name": "contract_content_changed"
      }],
      "request": {
        "method": "POST",
        "url": "http://master.ci.my.domain:8085/rest/api/latest/queue/SOME-PROJECT?os_authType=basic",
        "username": "username",
        "password": "password",
        "headers": {
          "Accept": "application/json"
        }
      }
    }

A request body can be specified as well.

    {
      "events": [{
        "name": "contract_content_changed"
      }],
      "request": {
        "method": "POST",
        "url": "http://example.org/something",
        "body": {
          "some" : "json"
        }
      }
    }

**BEWARE** The password can be reverse engineered from the database, so make a separate account for the Pact Broker to use, don't use your personal account!

#### Event types

`contract_content_changed:` triggered when the content of the contract has changed since the previous publication. Uses plain string equality, so changes to the ordering of hash keys, or whitespace changes will trigger this webhook.

`provider_verification_published:` triggered whenever a provider publishes a verification.

### Dynamic variable substitution

The following variables may be used in the request parameters or body, and will be replaced with their appropriate values at runtime.

`${pactbroker.pactUrl}`: the "permalink" URL to the newly published pact (the URL specifying the consumer version URL, rather than the "/latest" format.)

Example usage:

    {
      "events": [{
        "name": "contract_content_changed"
      }],
      "request": {
        "method": "POST",
        "url": "http://example.org/something",
        "body": {
          "thisPactWasPublished" : "${pactbroker.pactUrl}"
        }
      }
    }

### Testing

To test a webhook, navigate to the webhook in the HAL browser, then make a POST request to the "execute" relation. The response or error will be shown in the window.

### Deleting

Send a DELETE request to the webhook URL.

### Updating

Send a PUT request to the webhook URL with all fields required for the new webhook.
